<div id="prediction" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.1</span> Prediction</h4>
<p>In many cases, predictors <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are readily available, but <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not. We can however predict <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, as the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> averages to zero. Often, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> is treated as a black box when prediction is of interest, as one is typically not concerned with the exact form of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span>, provided that it yields accurate predictions for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducible error: the misspecification error that is due to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> is usually not a perfect estimate of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, that can potentially be improved.</li>
<li>Irreducible error: <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not only a function of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, but also of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>; and the variability associated with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> affects our predictions. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> may contain unmeasured variables and/or unmeasured variation.
<ul>
<li>Given that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)\)</span>, assume that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are fixed.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align} E(Y - \hat{Y})^2 &amp;= E[f(X) + \epsilon - \hat{f}(X)]^2 \\
&amp;= [f(X) - \hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\epsilon)
\end{align}\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(E(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> represents the expected value of the squared difference between the predicted and actual value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Var(\epsilon)\)</span> the variability associated with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span></li>
<li>The irreducible error provides the upper bound of the accuracy of the predictions, but this upper bound is generally unknown in practice.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="inference" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.2</span> Inference</h4>
<p>The goal of inference is to understand how <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> changes as a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If this is the case, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> cannot be treated as a black box, because we need to know its exact form. Questions of interest can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which predictors are associated with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>?</li>
<li>What is the relation between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and each predictor?</li>
<li>Can the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and each predictor be adequately summarized with a linear equation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to find a function <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(Y \approx \hat{f}(X)\)</span> for any observation <span class="math inline">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="parametric-methods" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.3</span> Parametric methods</h4>
<ul>
<li>Parametric methods make an assumptions about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</li>
<li>After selecting a global model, we need a procedure that trains the model (in linear regression, this refers to estimating the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\)</span>). Parametric approaches reduce the problem of estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> down to one of estimating a set of parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming a parametric form for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> simplifies the problem of estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as it generally is much easier to estimate a set of parameters than it is to fit an entirely arbitrary function. However, a potential drawback is that the model considered in a parametric approach usually not matches the true unknown form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. This can be partly overcome by fitting more flexible models, which in turn might lead to overfitting.</p>

<p>Restrictive models are much more interpretable. Very flexible approaches may lead to such complicated estimates of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that it is difficult to understand how any individual predictor is associated with the response. For example, the lasso is more restrictive than OLS in estimating the coefficients and sets some of them to exactly zero. It is more interpretable than OLS, because in the final model there are less coefficients, so one only has to interpret a subset of the coefficients that would have been included in OLS regression. GAMs extend the linear model by allowing non-linear relationships, but the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is now modeled as a curve, which complicates interpretation.</p>
<p>Supervised learning: a response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is related to a set of predictors <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, with the aim to predict or infer the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Unsupervised learning: We only have predictors <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the goal is to understand relations between the variables or between the observations.</p>
<p>Regression problems: quantitative response.</p>
<p>Classification problems: qualitative response.</p>
<p>However, logistic regression is typically used in a qualitative setting, but as it estimates probabilities, it can be thought of as a regression method as well. Some methods (K-nearest neighbors; boosting) can be used for both quantitative or qualitative responses.</p>

<p>The mean squared error (MSE) should be calculated on the test data.

<p>The expected test MSE for a given value <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> can be decomposed into the sum of three fundamental quantities: the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(x_0)\)</span>, the squared bias of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(x_0)\)</span> and the variance of the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>.

<li>Variance: the amount by which <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> would change if we estimated it using a different training set.</li>
<li>Bias: the error that is introduced by simplifying a complicated real-life problem with a much simpler model.</li>

<p>Generally, more flexible methods induce less bias but more variance. As we increase the flexibility of a class of methods, the bias initially tends to decrease faster than the variance increases, and thus the MSE declines.

<p>Parametric methods are easy to fit, because one only needs to estimate a relatively small number of coefficients, and if linear regression is used, coefficients have a simple interpretation. However, by definition, parametric models make strong assumptions about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>. If the specified functional form is far from the truth, and predictive accuracy is our goal, the parametric method will perform poorly. Non-parametric methods do not explicitly assume a parametric form for <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>, and thereby provide more flexibility.</p>
<p>K-nearest neighbor regression - given a value for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and a prediction point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, KNN regression identifies the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> training observations closest to <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_0\)</span>) and estimates <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0)\)</span> using the average of all training reponses in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}_0\)</span>. The optimal value for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> depends on the bias / variance trade-off.</p>
<p>Parametric approaches will outperform non-parametric approaches if the selected parametric form is close to the true form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Also, in higher dimensions, KNN often performs worse than linear regression, due to the curse of dimensionality (the nearest observations to a given test observation <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> may be far away from <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensional space, especially when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is large), leading to poor predictions.</p>

<p>The MSE <span class="math inline">\((RSS / n)\)</span> in the training set is generally an underestimate of the test MSE.

Typically, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}^2\)</span> is estimated using the full model containing all predictors. Thus, the <span class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span> statistic adds a penalty of <span class="math inline">\(2d\hat{\sigma}^2\)</span> to the training RSS to adjust for the fact that the training error tends to underestimate the test error.

<p>The least squares fitting procedure estimates <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\)</span>, using the values that minimize
<span class="math display">\[
RSS = \sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum^p_{j=1}\beta_jx_{ij})^2.
\]</span>
Ridge regression is very similar to least squares, except that the coefficients are estimated by minimizing a slightly different quantity
<span class="math display">\[
\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum^p_{j=1}\beta_jx_{ij})^2 + 
\lambda\sum^p_{j=1}\beta^2_j = RSS + \lambda\sum^p_{j=1}\beta^2_j
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \geq 0\)</span> is a tuning parameter, to be determined separately. As with least squares, ridge regression seeks coefficient estimates that fit the data well, by making the RSS small. The second term, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\sum^p_{j=1}\beta^2_j\)</span>, called a shrinkage penalty is small when <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\)</span> are close to zero, and so it has the effect of shrinking the estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> towards zero. The tuning parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> serves to control the relative impact of this term on the regression coefficient estimates. When <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>, the penalty term has no effect and ridge regression will produce the least squares estimates. Ridge regression will produce a different set of coefficient estimates, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}^R_{\lambda}\)</span>, for each value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Note that we do not shrink the value of the intercept, as it remains the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when all <span class="math inline">\(X&#39;s\)</span> are zero.</p>
<p>Standard least squares regression coefficient estimates are scale equivariant; regardless of the scale of <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_j\hat{\beta}_j\)</span> will remain the same. The ridge regression coefficients can change substantially when the scale is changed. Namely, <span class="math inline">\(X_j\hat{\beta}^R_{j,\lambda}\)</span> will not only depend on the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, but also on the scaling of the other predictors and on the scaling of the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> predictor. Therefore, it is best to apply ridge regression after standardizing the predictors.</p>
<p>Ridge regression’s advantage over least squares is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias. When the relationship between the response and the predictors is linear, least squares estimates will have low bias, but may have a high variance. When <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is almost as large as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, least squares coefficients will be extremely variable, and if <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; n\)</span>, least squares estimates do not have a unique solution. In these situations, ridge regression can still perform well by trading off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. Hence, ridge regression works best when least squares estimates have high variance. Also, ridge regression is computationally much more efficient than best subset selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-lasso" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3.2</span> The lasso</h4>
<p>Ridge regression has one obvious disadvantage, as it will include all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> predictors in the final model. The penalty <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \sum^p_{j=1} \hat{\beta}_j^2\)</span> will shrink all coefficients towards zero, but it will not set any of them to exactly zero (unless <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \infty\)</span>), which may complicate model interpretation (especially when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is large). The lasso overcomes this disadvantage, by estimating coefficients that minimize the quantity</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum^p_{j=1}\beta_jx_{ij})^2 + \sum^p_{j=1}|\beta_j|
= RSS + \lambda\sum^p_{j=1}|\beta_j|.
\]</span></p>
<p>So, the term <span class="math inline">\(\beta^2_j\)</span> in the ridge regression penalty is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(|\beta_j|\)</span>. This penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is sufficiently large. So, the lasso performs variable selection, and thus the lasso yields “sparse” models that are easier to interpret.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>, the lasso provides the least squares fit, and when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \infty\)</span>, all coefficients are set equal to 0, just as ridge regression. However, in between these two extremes, the ridge regression and lasso models are quite different. Depending on <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the lasso can produce a model involving any number of predictors, while ridge regression will always include all variables in the model.</p>
<p>When we perform the lasso, we are trying to find a set of coefficient estimates that lead to the smallest RSS, subject to the constraint that there is a budget <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> for how large <span class="math inline">\(\sum^p_{j=1}|\beta_j|\)</span> can be. When <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is extremely large, the budget is not very restrictive, and so the parameters can be large. In fact, if <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is large enough that the least squares solution falls within the budget, the lasso will give the least squares solution. But if <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is small, then <span class="math inline">\(\sum^p_{j=1}|\beta_j|\)</span> must be small in order to avoid violating the budget. Similarly, when we perform ridge regression, we seek a set of coefficient estimates such that the RSS is as small as possible subject to the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(\sum^p_{j=1}\beta^2_j\)</span> not exceeds the budget <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can interpret ridge regression and the lasso as computationally feasible alternatives to best subset selection (one can regard the budget as the number of variables that must be set equal to 0). Then, the lasso is closest to best subset selection, since only the lasso performs subset selection, given that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is sufficiently small.</p>
<p>Since ridge regression has a circular constraint with no sharp point, the intersection of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and the RSS will not generally occur on an axis, and so the regression coefficient estimates will be exclusively non-zero. The lasso constraints have corners at each of the aces, and so the ellipses will often intersect the constraint region at an axis. If all predictors in a dataset/model are truely related to the response, ridge regression will generally outperform the lasso in terms of prediction error. The lasso namely implicitly assumes that a number of the coefficients are truly equal to zero. Neither ridge regression not the lasso will universally dominate the other. In general, one might expect the lasso to perform better when a relatively small number of predictors have substantial effects, while the remaining predictors have small or no effects. Ridge regression will perform better when many predictors all have similar effects. However, in practice the relationships between predictors and response is not known a priori. Techniques as cross-validation can be used in order to determine which approach is better on a particular data set.</p>
<p>As with ridge regression, when the least squares estimates have excessively high variance, the lasso solution can yield a reduction in variance at the expense of a small increase in bias. Ridge regression more or less shrinks every dimension of the data by the same proportion, whereas the lasso more or less shrinks all coefficients toward zero by a similar amount (soft-thresholding), and sufficiently small coefficients are shrunken all the way to zero.</p>

<p>One randomly divides the available data into a training set and a validation set. The model is than fitted / trained on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The resulting validation set error rate (typically assessed by the MSE) provides an estimate of the test error rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>The validation estimate of the test error rate can be highly variable, depending on precisely which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the validation set.</li>
<li>In the validation approach, only a subset of the observations - those in the training set - are used to fit the model.

<div id="leave-one-out-cross-validation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4.2</span> Leave-one-out cross-validation</h4>
<p>LOOCV uses a single observation as the validation set. This procedure is repeated for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CV_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}MSE_i.
\]</span>
Advantages of LOOCV over the validation set approach are that LOOCV has far less bias, as much more of the information in the data is used to train the model. Consequently, LOOCV tends not to oberestimate the test error rate as much as the validation set approach does. Also, in contrast to the validation set approach, which will yield different results when applied repeatedly due to randomness in training/validation splits, LOOCV will always yield the same result, as there is no randomness.</p>
<p>However, LOOCV has the potential to be expensive to implement in terms of time, especially when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large or when each individual model is slow to fit. However, with least squares linear or polynomial regression, a shortcut makes the cost of LOOCV the same as that of a single model fit.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}\Bigg(\frac{y_i-\hat{y}_i}{1-h_i}\Bigg)^2

This is like the ordinary MSE, except the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> residual is divided by <span class="math inline">\(1-h_i\)</span>. The leverage lies between <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and reflects the amount that an observation influences its own fit. Hence, the residuals for high-leverage points are inflated in this formula by exactly the right amount for this equality to hold.</p>

<p>Randomly dividing the set of observations into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> groups or folds of approximately the same size. For <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \dots, k\)</span> the model is fit on data <span class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> and validated on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> using the MSE, so there are <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> estimates of the test error: <span class="math inline">\(MSE_1, MSE_2, \dots, MSE_k\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CV_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum^k_{i=1}MSE_i
\]</span></p>
<p>LOOCV is a special case of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold cross-validation with <span class="math inline">\(k=n\)</span>. Typically, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold cross-validation is performed with <span class="math inline">\(k=5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(k=10\)</span>. The main advantage of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV is computational. Also, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV is a very general approach that can be applied to almost any statistical learning method. Some statistical learning methods have computationally intensive fitting procedures, and performing LOOCV may pose computational problems, especially if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is extremely large. 10-fold CV might ten be much more feasible.</p>
<p>When using 10-fold CV, there is some variability in the CV estimates, as a result of the variability in how the observations are divided into folds, but this variability is typically much lower than the variability in the test error estimates that result from the validation set approach.</p>
<p>When we perform cross-validation, our goal might be to determine how well a given statistical learning procedure can be expected to perform on independent data. In this case, the actual estimate of the test MSE is of interest. Other times, we are interested only in the location of the minimum point in the estimated test MSE curve, because we might be performing CV on a number of statistical learning methods, or on a single method using different levels of flexibility in order to identify the method that results in the lowest test error. Then, the actual value of the estimated test MSE is not very important. Despite the fact that LOOCV and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV sometimes underestimate the true test MSE, both approaches come close to identifying the correct level of flexibility.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-Fold cross validation often gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than LOOCV, due to the bias-variance trade-off. The validation set approach can lead to overestimates of the test error rate, since it uses only part of the information in the data. Extending this viewpoint, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV should perform somewhat better, and LOOCV is to be preferred over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that LOOCV has higher variance than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold cross-validation with <span class="math inline">\(k&lt;n\)</span>. When we perform LOOCV, we are averaging the outputs of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> fitted models, each of which is trained on a nearly identical set of observations. Therefore, the outputs are highly positively correlated with each other. With <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV with <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span> the correlations are smaller, as the overlap between the training sets is smaller. Since the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than the test error estimate resulting from <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-fold CV.</p>

<p>Polynomial functions impose a global structure on the non-linear function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We can use step functions to avoid imposing such a global structure. We break the range of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into bins, and fit a different constant in each bin. This amounts to converting a continuous variable into an ordered categorical variable, by using dummies (i.e., an indicator variable). Then, the model can be written as

For any given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, at most one of the <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span> can be non-zero.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5.3</span> Basis functions</h4>
<p>Polynomial and piecewise-constant functions are in fact special cases of a basis function approach: we use a family of functions or transformations applied to a variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(b_1(X), b_2(X), \dots, b_K(X)\)</span>.

<p>The basis functions are fixed and known, i.e., they are specified before fitting the model.

</div>
<div id="regression-splines" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5.4</span> Regression splines</h4>
<p>Piecewise polynomial regression involves fitting a separate low degree polynomial over different regions of X. The points where the coefficients change are called the knots. A piecewise cubic polynomial with a single knot at a point <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> takes the form
<span class="math display">\[
y_i =

    \beta_{01} + \beta_{11}x_i + \beta_{21}x^2_i + \beta_{31}x^3_i + \epsilon_i   ~~~~~\text{if}~x_i &lt; c_i \\

  \end{cases}
\]</span>
Each of these polynomial functions can be fit using least squares applied to simple functions of the original predictor.</p>
<p>Using more knots leads to a more flexible piecewise polynomial. Piecewise constant functions are piecewise polynomials of degree zero. However, a problem of piecewise polynomial regression is that it is likely to be a discontinuous function. A piecewise polynomial function of the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> power with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> knots uses <span class="math inline">\(k(j+1)\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>However, we can fit a piecewise polynomial under the constraint that the fitted curve must be continuous. However, there may then be sharp angles in the fitted regression slopes that look unnatural as well. We can remedy this by adding the constraints that the first and second derivative must be the same. Then, it is required that the transition at the knot is also very smooth. Each constraint that we impose effectively frees one degree of freedom. When we also constrain the first and second derivative to be equal, we end up with a cubic spline. In general, a cubic spline with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> knots uses <span class="math inline">\(4 + K\)</span> degrees of freedom. The general definition of a degree-<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> spline is that it is a piecewise degree-<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomial, with continuity in derivatives up to degree <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span> at each knot.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-splines-basis-representation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5.5</span> The splines basis representation</h4>
<p>We can use the basis model to represent a regression spline. A cubic spline with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> knots can be represented as
<span class="math display">\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 b_1(x_i) + \beta_2 b_2(x_i) + \dots + \beta_{K+3} b_{K+3}(x_i) + \epsilon_i
\]</span>
for an appropriate choice of basis functions <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{K+3}\)</span>. The model can be fit using least squares. The most direct way to represent a cubic spline is to start off with a basis for a cubic polynomial - namely, <span class="math inline">\(x, x^2, x^3\)</span> - and then add one truncated power basis function per knot. A truncated power basis function is defined as
<span class="math display">\[
h(x,\xi)^3_+ = 
  \begin{cases}
  (x-\xi) &amp;\text{if}~ x&gt; \xi \\
  0 &amp;\text{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is the knot. Adding the term of the form <span class="math inline">\(\beta_4h(x,\xi)\)</span> for a cubic polynomial will lead to a discontinuity in only the third derivative at <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>; the function will remain continuous, with continuous first and second derivatives at each of the knots.</p>
<p>In order to fit a cubic spline to a dataset with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> knots, we perform least squares regression with an intercept and <span class="math inline">\(3+K\)</span> predictors of the form <span class="math inline">\(X, X^2, X^3, h(X, \xi_1), h(X,\xi_2), \dots, h(X,\xi_K)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\xi_1, \dots, \xi_K\)</span> are the knots. This amounts to estimating a total of <span class="math inline">\(K+4\)</span> degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, splines can have high variance at the outer range of the predictors (i.e., where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is small or large). To overcome this, one can use a natural spline, which is a regression spline with additional boundary constraints: the function is required to be linear at the boundary (in the region where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is smaller (larger) than the smallest (largest) knot). This means that natural splines generally produce more stable estimates at the boundaries.</p>

<div id="choosing-the-number-and-locations-of-the-knots" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5.6</span> Choosing the number and locations of the knots</h4>
<p>Regression splines are most flexible in regions that contain a lot of knots, because in those regions the polynomial coefficients can change rapidly. Hence, it is an option to place more knots in places where we feel the function might vary most rapidly, and fewer where it seems more stable. However, in practice it is more common to place knots in a uniform fashion. One can specify the desired degrees of freedom and have the software automatically place the corresponding number of knots at uniform quantiles of the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural spline with four degrees of freedom and three knots (<span class="math inline">\(25^{th}, 50^{th}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentile) - there are actually five knots (also the boundary knots). A cubic spline with five knots would have 9 degrees of freedom, but natural cubic splines have two additional natural constraints at each of the boundaries to enforce linearity, resulting in <span class="math inline">\(9-4=5\)</span> degrees of freedom. One of these <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> df gets absorbed by the intercept, and hence, we have <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> df.</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine the number of knots, one could simply assess which curve looks best. A somewhat more objective approach is to use cross-validation, to determine the number of knots that fit the data best.</p>
<p>Regression splines often give superior results to polynomial regression, because unlike polynomials, which must use a high degree to produce flexible fits, splines introduce flexibility by increasing the number of knots, but keeping the degree fixed. Generally, splines produce more stable estimates. Splines also allow to place more knots, and hence flexibility, over regions where the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> seems to be changing more rapidly, and fewer knots where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is more stable.</p>

We can specify <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> directly, or use cross-validation.</p>
<p>In a setting with multiple features <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \dots, X_p\)</span>, a useful generalization involves fitting a multiple linear regression model that is global in some variables and local in other, more varying variables.

<div id="generalized-additive-models" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5.10</span> Generalized additive models</h4>
<p>GAMs provide a general framework for extending a linear model by allowing non-linear functions of each of the variables, while maintaining additivity. A natural way to extend the multiple linear regression model in order to allow for non-linear relationships between each feature and the response is to replace each linear component <span class="math inline">\(\beta_jx_{ij}\)</span> with a smooth non-linear function <span class="math inline">\(f_j(x_{ij})\)</span>, by writing the model as
<span class="math display">\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \sum^p_{j=1} f_j(x_{ij}) + \epsilon_i.
\]</span>
This is called an additive model, because we calculate a separate <span class="math inline">\(f_j\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> and then add together all of their contributions.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of GAMS</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: GAMs allow us to fit a non-linear <span class="math inline">\(f_j\)</span> to each <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span>, so that we can model non-linear relationships automatically that standard linear regression will miss. So, we do not need to manually try out many different transformations on each variable individually.</li>
<li>Pro: Potential to make more accurate predictions for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li>Pro: Additivity - we can still examine the effects of each <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> individually while holding all other variables fixed.</li>
<li>Pro: The smoothness of the function <span class="math inline">\(f_j\)</span> for the variable <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> can be summarized via degrees of freedom.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Model accuracy</h3>
<p>The predictions of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> differ from the true <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and we can evaluate how much this happens “on average”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean squared error: <span class="math inline">\(MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\)</span>.</li>

<li>Proportion of explained variance: <span class="math inline">\(R^2 = \text{correlation}(y,\hat{y})^2\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In training data, more flexible models <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(x)\)</span> may overfit the data, that is, they model the noise in the data.</p>
<p>Unbiased: model that gives the correct prediction, on average, over samples from the target population.</p>
<p>High variance: model that easily overfits accidental patterns.</p>
<p>Modes with more flexibility have less bias, but they also have higher variance. Bias and variance are implicityly linked because they are both affected by model complexity.</p>
<p>Complexity: the amount of variation in the data that is absorbed into the model; the amount of compression performed on the data by the model; the number of effective parameters, relative to the effective degrees of freedom in the data.</p>
<p>So, models with more predictors have a higher complexity, but also models with higher order polynomials and smaller neighborhoods in KNN have more complexity.</p>
<p>Note that the bias-variance trade-off occurs just as much with <span class="math inline">\(n = 100,000,000\)</span> as with <span class="math inline">\(n = 5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The expected value of the MSE equals <span class="math inline">\(E(MSE) = \text{bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \sigma^2\)</span>, so, the population mean squared error equals the squared bias plus the model variance, plus the irreducible variance. As <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in KNN decreases, the model becomes more complex, and the variance increases.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a wrong model is better than a true model (on average).</p>
<p>Or, if you do not believe in true models: sometimes a simple model is better than a more complex one. These factors together determine what works best:</p>
<ul>
<li>How close the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(x)\)</span> is to the true <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>;</li>
<li>The amount of irreducible variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>);</li>
<li>The sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>;</li>
<li>The complexity of the model <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, df or equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the true <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, you can easily calculate the <span class="math inline">\(E(MSE)\)</span> (this is sometimes called the Bayes error). However, in practice, we do not know the truth. However, we can estimate the truth using the training-validation-test paradigm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Training data - the observations used to fit <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Validation (/dev) data - new observations from the same source as training data (often used several times to select the model complexity).</li>
<li>Test data: New observations from the intended prediction situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the average squared error in the test set <span class="math inline">\(MSE_{\text{test}}\)</span> is an estimate of the Bayes error <span class="math inline">\(E(MSE)\)</span>. However, this only holds when the test set is “like” the intended prediction situation.</p>
<p>Drawbacks of the train/validation split are that the validation estimate of the test error can be highly variable, depending on precisely which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the validation set; in the validation approach, only a subset of the observations - those that are included in the training set rather than in the validation set - are used to fit the model. This suggests that the validation set error may tend to overestimate the test error for the model fit on the entire dataset.</p>
<p>K-fold cross validation is often used to replace the single “dev” set approach. Namely, one performs the train/dev split several times, and averages the model accuracy. Usually, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is set to equal 5 or 10. When <span class="math inline">\(K = N\)</span>, we have leave-one-out cross-validation. Note that <strong>any procedure that makes decisions based on the data</strong> requires validation. Getting good test data is a difficult problem.</p>

<p>The bias-variance tradeoff again: more flexibility is good, as it results in less bias; but it is bed in the sense that it results in a higher variance. So what if we made a very flexible model, but told it not to go overboard with the complexity (judging that by validation data)?</p>
<p>There are generally three ways to do so.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Subset selection: you can buy at most <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> things - pick the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> best predictors of the model (this is called a wrapper); you can only buy the things you like more than <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> - only pick predictors that correlate more than <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (this is called a filter).</li>
<li>Shrinkage (“penalization”, “regularization”): you can buy what you want, but don’t spend more than <span class="math inline">\(\$s\)</span> - keeping the sum of squared (<span class="math inline">\(l_2\)</span>) or absolute (<span class="math inline">\(l_1\)</span>) coefficients below some budget <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, for example ridge regression or the lasso (which is called an embedded method).</li>
<li>Dimension reduction (–&gt; unsupervised learning) - run an unsupervised model first, then predict <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> from the resulting <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> scores.</li>

</div>
<div id="wrapper-methods" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Wrapper methods</h3>
<p><strong>The three common algorithms for subset selection</strong></p>
<p>Best subset selection - fit all possible models with at most <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> predictors and choose the “best” one (using a metric of choice). The major drawback of this is that this results in <span class="math inline">\(2^p\)</span> possible models, so with a large <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, this is not feasible. However, this approach does provide the best model in the set.</p>
<p>Forward stepwise - let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_0\)</span> denote the null model, which contains no predictors; then for <span class="math inline">\(k = 0, \dots, p-1\)</span> consider all <span class="math inline">\(p-k\)</span> models that augment the predictors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_k\)</span> with one additional predictor and choose the best among these <span class="math inline">\(p-k\)</span> models, and call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\)</span>; then, select a single best model from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_0, \dots, \mathcal{M}_p\)</span>. This approach results in a much more reasonable number of models to estimate.</p>
<p>Backward stepwise - let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_p\)</span> denote the full model, which contains all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> predictors; then, for <span class="math inline">\(k = p, p-1, \dots, 1\)</span> consider all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> models that contain <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> predictors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_k\)</span> and choose the best among these <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> models, and call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{k-1}\)</span>; then select a single best model from among <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_0, \dots, \mathcal{M}_p\)</span>, which also results in a reasonable number of models to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapper feature selection - pros and cons</strong></p>
<p>Best subset selection is an exhaustive search - it finds the best subset, as advertised - when there is enough data to find it; however, it also fits an enormous number of models when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is large, and it is likely that you will run out of validation data quickly.</p>
<p>Forward / backward selection are both much more efficient; however, it is a greedy search that does not guarantees to find the best subset.</p>
<p>Forward versus backward: forward is usually more efficient; sometimes backward is not even possible (when <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; n\)</span>); however, forward can be fooled, especially when two variables work together but do nothing alone, while backward selection considers the performance of variables together with others. However, both backward and forward are well-known to be bad at finding the “true” subset of predictors, but this does not matter that much when we are only after prediction.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Embedded methods</h3>
<p>Regularization - buying coefficients on a budget.</p>
<p>The algorithm wants to fit the training data, by buying coefficients at the cost of variance - penalize selecting too many coefficients. Regularization is an extremely efficient way to approximately solve the best subset problem, and it often yields very good results.</p>
<p>Ordinary least squares regression finds the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> that minimizes

<p>We can see the penalties as a budget of coefficients. The lasso penalizes in such a way that the coefficients shrink to exactly 0, while ridge regression shrinks the estimates toward 0, but not to exactly 0.</p>
